    "What is a good rule for how many bins there should be?\n",
    "A guideline is that you want a histogram to accurately capture the underlying distribution\n",
    "without introducing artifacts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Too wide bins can hide detail in the distribution,\n",
    "  e.g. bimodality might not show up since a single bin covers both peaks.\n",
    "- Too narrow narrow bins can suggest additional detail\n",
    "  that is an artifact of the limited size of the sample\n",
    "  and/or the exact arrangement of the bins.\n",
    "  This often shows up as the histogram appearing to have multiple small spikes\n",
    "  (note that there are case where multiple small spikes could indicate a true property of the distribution,\n",
    "  e.g. a periodicity so it is important to think about this in the context of the specific dataset you are working with).\n",
    "\n",
    "You also want to avoid unequal bin sizes,\n",
    "since it would not be fair to compare the height of these,\n",
    "and ideally have the bins line up nicely with the x-axis so that the interval the cover is easily identifiable.\n",
    "In practice,\n",
    "it is a good idea to experiment with a few different bin size to better understand the distribution of your data\n",
    "and how to accurately present it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both Altair and ggplot uses an automatic rule to compute a suggested optimal number of bin,\n",
    "which is usually quite good.\n",
    "Altair then also snaps the bins to the same width as the x-axis ticks,\n",
    "so that it is easy to read which interval they cover.\n",
    "This snapping sometimes creates to wide bins\n",
    "so you might need to increase the `maxbins` in Altair.\n",
    "In ggplot,\n",
    "you might occasionally want to create fewer bins than the default.\n",
    "\n",
    "[This page has additional detail about bins widths\n",
    "and examples of how histograms with too many and too few bins can look like](https://answerminer.com/blog/binning-guide-ideal-histogram)."
